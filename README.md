# Intrusion Detection System

## Overview
  A common pipeline known as the ELK stack allows for data ingestion, processing, and visualization. This pipeline uses:
   - **Snort** - Detects network intrusions and generates alerts for suspicious traffic.
   - **Filebeat** - Forwards Snort logs to Logstash.
   - **Logstash** - Processes and parses data to prepare it for Elasticsearch.
   - **Elasticsearch** - Stores and indexes logs for fast searching.
   - **Kibana** - Visualizes data and provides dashboards for threat analysis.

## Key Features
  - **Event Monitoring**: Track security events and analyze trends.
  - **Traffic Flow Analysis**: Visualize inbound and outbound network traffic.
  - **Source/Destination Analysis**: Identify IPs associated with suspicious activities.
  - **Protocol Insights**: Understand network usage and spot unusual protocol behavior.
  - **Alerting**: Real-time alerts based on Snort's detections.
  - **Performance Metrics**: Dashboards to monitor system health and performance.

## Example Dashboards
  - **Event Monitoring Dashboard**: Provides an overview of security events over time.
