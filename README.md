# Intrusion Detection System

## Overview
  A common pipeline known as the ELK stack allows for data ingestion, processing, and visualization. This pipeline uses:
   - **Snort** - Detects network intrusions and generates alerts for suspicious traffic.
   - **Filebeat** - Forwards Snort logs to Logstash.
   - **Logstash** - Processes and parses data to prepare it for Elasticsearch.
   - **Elasticsearch** - Stores and indexes logs for fast searching.
   - **Kibana** - Visualizes data and provides dashboards for threat analysis.
     
## Key Features
  - **Event Monitoring**: Track security events and analyze trends.
